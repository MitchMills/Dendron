## Selection and Transformation
- Both utilize the basics of a loop:
  - a loop
  - a counter
  - a way to retrieve the vurrent value
  - a way to exit the loop
- Both also require *criteria*
### Selection
- Choosing certain elements from a collection
  - Criteria determine which elements are selected
  - If there are n elements in a collection, selection results in n or less elements
### Transformation
- Manipulating every element in the collection
  - Criteria determine how to perform transformation
  - If there are n elements in a collection, transformation results in exactly n elements
